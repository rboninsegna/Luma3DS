# Puma33DS
*(N?)3DS "Custom Firmware"*

I've made this CFW because I am dissatisfied with how Luma forces the user to apply certain patches despite the fact they're not clearly required for reasonable operation (and some are in fact counter-productive in specific scenarios), while yet being my favorite CFW on almost every other point.

If you couldn't tell, 99% of the code is made by upstream, by up-upstream, etc

I don't plan to mantain the dev branch, but key features may be merged.

It is not inherently A9LH exclusive but I don't plan on trying to maintain compatibility with the .dat build.

Mainly that. If you really want to look into it, you could read it as "Pro Luma" given the main difference...

## Storage Folder
Since I only use one CFW at a time,
and partially out of respect for the original project,
and it's Well Known that nobody likes folders on root,
and I'm lazy,

I've decided to keep using /luma/. Note however that **the config.bin of Luma and Puma are incompatible, so be sure to delete it when switching**.

## Compiling

First you need to install DevKitARM.

As of 2016-8-1 you'll also need manually compile and install an updated ctrulib, as the bundled one is too old.

You will also need [armips](https://github.com/Kingcom/armips), [bin2c](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bin2c/), and a recent build of [makerom](https://github.com/profi200/Project_CTR) added to your PATH (for example, in devkitARM/bin/).
For your convenience, here are [Windows](http://www91.zippyshare.com/v/ePGpjk9r/file.html) and [Linux](https://mega.nz/#!uQ1T1IAD!Q91O0e12LXKiaXh_YjXD3D5m8_W3FuMI-hEa6KVMRDQ) builds of armips (thanks to who compiled them!).  

Then clone the repository recursively with: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/rboninsegna/Puma33DS.git`

Finally just run `make a9lh` and everything should work!

You can find the compiled files in the 'out' folder.
